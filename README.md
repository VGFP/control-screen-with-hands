# This repository is a simple demo how to use handtracking to interact with a website.
Check out the demo here: https://vgfp.github.io/control-screen-with-hands/
More updates are coming soon.
## Used libraries
- [Handtrack.js]

## Some thoughts
Web is not best for using handtracking as a tool for interactions with a content. Main issue is a preformance. But it also allows for touchless interactions with a content. I think it will be usefull for self-order kiosks in restaurants and smart mirrors.

## TODO
- [x] Add a demo that uses 3D engine like babylon.js
- [ ] Add a demo that incorporates handtracking with headtracking from jeelizFaceFilter
